    <li>Note that now we are importing our Layouts and we attribute one of them to a variable called Layout depending if the user is signed or not (note that we could have other layouts and other logic to define which one would be used depending on the application).</li>
    <li>Now, instead of passing the Component directly, we us a property called render. Inside this property we can return our Layout with the component as a child.</li>
</ul>
